<br>
This project is a basic responsive card layout built using HTML5 and CSS3. It showcases a clean and structured design featuring:
A header image with rounded corners<br>
Tag-style labels for content categorization (e.g., Nature, Flower)<br>
A title and a short description paragraph<br>
A styled "Read More" button to simulate interaction<br>

The design follows good UI/UX practices with visual hierarchy, border-radius for modern appearance, and consistent padding and spacing. Iâ€™ve also used custom classes, positioning, and border styling to organize and present content effectively.
ðŸ’¡ Key Skills Demonstrated:

Semantic HTML structure<br>
Custom CSS styling<br>
Box model understanding (padding, border, margin)<br>
Positioning elements with relative and absolute<br>
Building reusable components with CSS classes<br>

This project helped me understand how individual HTML and CSS properties work together to build user interfaces. It's a foundation for building more complex and interactive web applications.
